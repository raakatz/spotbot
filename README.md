# spotbot

A basic script that parses r/progmetal's posts from the past 24 hours and adds them to a Spotify playlist.

If you want to edit this for your own use, please follow the API documentation both for reddit and Spotify to learn how to acquire the credentials that get placed in the environment variables.

Credentials should be placed in a .env file in the project's root. Of course, it's included in .gitignore.

Enjoy!
